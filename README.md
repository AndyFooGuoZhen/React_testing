### What is Jest
Test runner that finds and runs test, determine if it passes of fails the test and reports it back in a human readable manner.

### React testing library
RTL provides a virtual DOM that we can use to interact with to test react component. 

### Types of automated tests
#### Unit tests
Tests individual blocks of application like class or components, dependencies are mocked

#### Integration test
Focus on testing a combination of units

#### E2E (End to end )
Testing the entire application flow. Involves real UI, database, real services.

### RTL philosophy
We are not concerned if the state changes or not. Focused on how the component behaves when a user interacts with it.
